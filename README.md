ROTATIONAL ROSE FORMATIONS (A PROJECT BY JORDAN ACCINELLI)

Here is the code for the "Rotational Rose Formations", a project currently running on my Instagram Account (@sines_n_lines).
It's designed as an exploration of Rhondonea Curve rotated through 3D spaces, and the interactivity of the layers.
This code is primitive as of current, and will be built upon with a UI to aide in user experience.
This has simply been redistributed to allow for other experimentation.
Any questions about the software can be sent to jtaccinelli@gmail.com, or can be asked through my Instagram Account.
Enjoy!
